# # core/ner.py
# # Purpose: Extract medical entities from natural patient language.
# # Patients describe symptoms conversationally — not clinically.
# # We use scispaCy for accurate medical term recognition and
# # medspaCy specifically for negation detection (the one genuinely
# # useful clinical NLP feature for our use case).
# # e.g. "no fever" → fever goes to negations not symptoms
# # e.g. "chest pain" → goes to symptoms, triggers HIGH severity
